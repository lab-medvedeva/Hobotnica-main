# Hobotnica
Hobotnica is a package that contains implementations of two algoritms (Hobotnice and classEVA) that measures how well the dataset was 
divided onto subgroups (given the matrix of distances between samples,or distance matrix, and a vector of labels characterizing the belonging of each sample in dataseet 
to one single group, or annotation) by a single real-valued coefficient which is close to null when the annotation is random and close to one when annotation is correct.
